[COST/ REWARD WARNING]: The actions in given problem manipulates its COST/REWARD.
                        Bear in mind that an action cost is 1 + the manipulation.
                        Therefore if an action A increases the reward in 1, then
                        the cost of A will be 0 (= 1 + (-1)).
